# Transaction Fraud Detection System

This repository contains a Python code for detecting fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset using the XGBoost algorithm.

**Dataset:**

The code uses a dataset containing financial transaction details, including transaction type, amount, origin and destination accounts, and a flag indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent.
The dataset has been retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1?resource=download.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Exploration:** The code explores the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the features and patterns associated with fraud.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handles missing values (if any).
    - Feature engineering: Creates new features that might be helpful in detecting fraud.
    - Addresses class imbalance: The dataset might contain significantly more non-fraudulent transactions than fraudulent ones. The code uses SMOTE oversampling to balance the classes.
3. **Model Training:**
    - An XGBoost classifier is used to train a model that learns to differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
    - The model's performance is evaluated using:
        - The Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC): A metric that measures the model's ability to identify true positive fraud cases while minimizing false positives.
        - Confusion matrix: Provides a breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.


**How to Use:**

1. **Dependencies:** Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed (see the code for the import statements).
2. **Dataset:** Download or have access to the financial transaction dataset.
3. **Google Colab (Recommended):** Run the code in Google Colab for easy access to resources and libraries.
4. **Modify Path:** Change the file path to your dataset in the code.
5. **Execute:** Run all the code cells sequentially.


**Output:**

The code outputs the AUPRC score and confusion matrix, which provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

**Overall:**

This code provides a framework for building a fraud detection system using machine learning. It demonstrates the use of essential data science steps, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can adapt and expand upon this code to further enhance its performance by exploring different algorithms, features, and techniques.
